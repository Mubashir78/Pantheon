## Resolved Architecture Decisions

### Backend: Olympus Backend Service
A new lightweight backend service runs alongside Hermes Agent. Stack: Python + FastAPI (keep simple; future standalone mobile app will prompt refactor). It serves:
- `POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/users`
- `GET/PUT /api/feature-flags`
- `GET/PUT /api/theme`
- `GET /api/athenaeum/walk`, `GET /api/athenaeum/read`, `GET /api/athenaeum/search`
- `GET /api/stream/entities`, `GET /api/stream/edges`, `GET /api/stream/metrics`

### Admin vs Settings
- **Settings** (gear ⚙): Profile, Appearance/Theme, Notifications, Integrations, Language, User Cron
- **Admin** (shield 🛡): Gods, Users & Roles, Feature Flags, System Cron, Health, Logs, Plugins, Skills, MCP, Terminal, Export

### Feature Toggles (11 total)
Cron, Plugins, Skills, MCP, Kanban, Webhooks, Terminal, Summon God, Edit God, Forge God, Multi-user mode.
OFF = hidden from UI, route blocked. Backend still exists.

### Theme System
- Runtime loading from Olympus backend (`GET /api/theme`)
- YAML format at `~/pantheon/config/olympus-theme.yaml`
- Terminology map included under `terminology:` block

### Auth
- localStorage tokens (upgrade to httpOnly cookies later)
- Single-user default, multi-user toggleable
- On multi-user ON: existing data auto-scoped to owner
- Login UX: grid of user icons → password prompt

### Route Tree
```
__root.tsx                          (checks onboarding_completed flag)
├── index.lazy.tsx                  / (chat)
├── login.lazy.tsx                  /login
├── settings.lazy.tsx               /settings (overlay from rail)
├── stream.lazy.tsx                 /stream
└── onboarding/
    ├── welcome.lazy.tsx
    ├── runtime-choice.lazy.tsx
    ├── custom/
    │   ├── inference.lazy.tsx
    │   ├── integrations.lazy.tsx
    │   ├── voice.lazy.tsx
    │   └── search.lazy.tsx
    └── complete.lazy.tsx
```

### Zustand Stores (6 total)
`auth-store` (extend), `onboarding-store`, `feature-flag-store`, `stream-store`, `user-store`, `search-store`

### Session Management
Mirror :8787 pattern — always-visible icon overlays: ☆ pin, ▾ context, ✏ rename, × delete

### QA Requirements (all new components)
- Matching `*.test.tsx` with render + interaction tests
- Mobile viewport check (≤768px)
- Basic keyboard nav (Tab/Enter/Escape)

---

## Pre-Build Investigations

| # | Task | Status | Depends on |
|---|------|--------|------------|
| I1 | Audit Hermes Agent plugin hooks — does `on_pre_write` exist for wiki ops? | 🔲 | Nothing |
| I2 | Research n8n credential types + BYOK flow | ✅ | Nothing → Deprecated: composio research superseded by n8n |

**Rule:** I1 must complete before Stream B starts. I2 must complete before T14 starts.

## Stream B: Integration Backend

> Hermes plugins + cron jobs. Independent of Stream A.
> Location: `~/.hermes/plugins/` and `~/.hermes/cron/pantheon-sync/`
> **Prerequisite:** I1 (Hermes plugin hooks audit) must complete first.

### I1 — Hermes Plugin Hooks Audit

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Complete |
| **Files** | Research only |

**Finding:** No dedicated wiki/content write hooks exist. Strategy confirmed:

- **`pre_tool_call`** — fires before any tool executes, can veto with `{"action": "block"}`. Use for WikiGuard (block low-quality content) and Dedup (block duplicates). Matcher: `athenaeum_write|write_file|patch`
- **`transform_tool_result`** — fires after tool returns, can rewrite result string. Use for Provenance (inject source/provider tags into result)
- 15 plugin hook types total. Key files: `hermes_cli/plugins.py:78-114` (VALID_HOOKS), `model_tools.py:688-696` (pre_tool_call dispatch at tool boundary)
- T8-T10 implementation: register `pre_tool_call` handler per plugin, gate content before it reaches the write tool. No new hook types needed.

---

### T8 — WikiGuard Admission Gate (P0a)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Complete |

---
---

### T9 — Source Tags + Provenance (P0b)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Complete |
| **Depends on** | Nothing |
| **Files** | `~/.hermes/plugins/wiki-provenance/` |

**What:** Every content chunk gets mandatory `source`, `provider`, `connector`, and `provenance` fields in frontmatter. Plugin auto-injects source/provider when metadata available.

**🚦 QA Gate T9:**
```
- [ ] plugin.yaml exists with hooks config
- [ ] Source/provider/connector injected into frontmatter
- [ ] Missing provenance = lint warning
- [ ] Tag rules: chat→telegram, web_import→github, etc.
```

---

### T10 — Content-Addressed Dedup (P0c)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Complete |
| **Depends on** | Nothing |
| **Files** | `~/.hermes/plugins/wiki-dedup/` |

**What:** SHA256-based dedup. Normalize content, compute hash, compare against index. Same content = no write.

**🚦 QA Gate T10:**
```
- [ ] compute_hash() normalizes whitespace correctly
- [ ] Same content → same hash (dedup hit)
- [ ] First write: stores hash + path in index
- [ ] Second write with identical content: blocked
- [ ] Index persists across restarts (JSON file)
```


### 🚦 Phase 0 Integration Gate (T8+T9+T10)
```
- [ ] All three plugins coexist without conflicts
- [ ] Test chunk → passes gate → has provenance → stored
- [ ] Duplicate chunk → dedup blocks it
- [ ] Junk chunk → gate drops it → logged to dropped.log
```

---

### T11 — Sync Scheduler (P1b)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Commit** | `0f959ef` (Pantheon repo) |
| **Depends on** | Phase 0 Gate |
| **Files** | `~/pantheon/cron/pantheon-sync/{sync_scheduler.py, sync_state.py, connections.json, README.md}` |

**What:** 20-minute cron loop. Walk active connections, check sync state, call adapter.

**🚦 QA Gate T11:**
```
- [ ] connections.json loads active connections
- [ ] SyncState: last_sync, cursor, records_today, daily budget
- [ ] Daily budget resets on date change
- [ ] Skips not-yet-due connections
- [ ] Skips over-budget connections
- [ ] Errors logged, scheduler never crashes
- [ ] Crontab: */20 * * * *
- [ ] Manual run_sync_tick() works
- [ ] scan.log records every tick
- [ ] Commit: "feat(sync): 20-min cron scheduler"
```

---

### T12 — Adapters: Gmail, GitHub, Slack (P1c)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Commit** | `12ad4a7` (Pantheon repo) |
| **Depends on** | Phase 0 Gate |
| **Files** | `cron/pantheon-sync/adapters/{__init__,base,gmail,github,slack}.py` |

**What:** Provider-specific adapters. Fetch → canonical Markdown + metadata.

**🚦 QA Gate T12:**
```
PER ADAPTER:
- [ ] get_adapter(provider) returns correct class
- [ ] sync() → {"records": [...], "next_cursor": ...}
- [ ] canonicalize() → {"content": "markdown...", "metadata": {...}}
- [ ] Empty results handled gracefully
- [ ] Auth failure logged clearly

GMAIL: sender/subject/body, provider="gmail", tags=["email"]
GITHUB: repo/event_type, provider="github", tags=["code"]
SLACK: sender/text/timestamp, provider="slack", tags=["chat"]

- [ ] Commit: "feat(adapters): Gmail, GitHub, Slack canonicalization"
```

### T13 — Codex-Stream Ingest Pipeline (P1d)

> **ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (2026-05-28):** Pipeline moved from `~/.hermes/cron/pantheon-sync/` to `~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream/ingest/` — it's now a self-contained Athenaeum Codex. Data lives alongside the pipeline. Raw chunks have 30-day TTL. Entities are promoted to permanent Codexes at ≥5 mentions. See Thoth handoff: `~/athenaeum/handoffs/hephaestus-handoff-2026-05-28-ingest-pipeline-move.md`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Commit** | `0f959ef` (scheduler), `12ad4a7` (adapters). Pipeline at `~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream/ingest/` (not git-tracked) |
| **Depends on** | T8, T9, T10, T11, T12 |
| **Files** | `~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream/ingest/{__init__,pipeline,chunker,hotness,cleanup}.py`. Modified: `~/pantheon/cron/pantheon-sync/sync_scheduler.py`. |
| **Note** | ✅ End-to-end verified: sync tick → chunks in raw/ → spaCy NER extracts entities → hotness updated. Co-occurrence edges logged to JSONL (Ichor graph write pending). |

**What:** Sync scheduler calls `ingest_into_codex_stream(canonical, connection)` → chunk (≤3k tokens, SHA256 IDs) → WikiGuard score → dedup check → provenance inject → write to `~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream/raw/{provider}/{date}/{chunk_id}.md`. Entity extraction (spaCy NER), co-occurrence edges → Ichor graph, hotness tracking. Daily cleanup: purge raw/ >30 days, promote entities ≥5 mentions.

**🚦 QA Gate T13:**
```
PIPELINE (pipeline.py):
- [ ] ingest_into_codex_stream(canonical, connection) → IngestResult(written=N, dropped=N, skipped=N)
- [ ] WikiGuard score gate called (T8) — DROP/BORDERLINE/KEEP respected
- [ ] Dedup check called (T10) — duplicates skipped
- [ ] Provenance injected (T9) — source/provider/connector in frontmatter
- [ ] Written to ~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream/raw/{provider}/{date}/{chunk_id}.md
- [ ] Handles empty/malformed adapter results gracefully (no crash)

CHUNKER (chunker.py):
- [ ] chunk_text() splits on paragraph boundaries, ≤3000 tokens
- [ ] Chunk IDs are SHA256 content-addressed
- [ ] Standalone: `python -c "from athenaeum.codex_stream.ingest.chunker import chunk_text; ..."` works

HOTNESS (hotness.py):
- [ ] HotnessTracker.increment(entity_name) works
- [ ] trending(n) returns top-N entities by mention count
- [ ] mark_promoted(entity) persists flag
- [ ] JSON persistence survives restarts (~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream/hotness.json)

CLEANUP (cleanup.py):
- [ ] CodexStreamCleanup.run() purges raw/ files >30 days old
- [ ] Empty date directories cleaned up after purge
- [ ] Entities with ≥5 mentions promoted to ~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream/entities/{slug}.md
- [ ] Promotion routing: default → Codex-General (configurable)
- [ ] Hotness decay applied to cold entities
- [ ] Cleanup never touches entities/, graph edges, or summaries
- [ ] Crontab: `0 2 * * * cd ~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream && python -m ingest.cleanup`

INTEGRATION:
- [ ] sync_scheduler.py imports from athenaeum.codex_stream.ingest.pipeline
- [ ] End-to-end: manual sync tick → chunks land in Codex-Stream/raw/
- [ ] spaCy NER extracts entities (zero LLM cost)
- [ ] Co-occurrence edges created in Ichor graph
- [ ] Commit: "feat(ingest): Codex-Stream pipeline — chunk + score + write + cleanup"
```

---

### 🚦 Phase 1 Integration Gate (T11+T12+T13)
```
- [ ] Gmail connected → sync tick → chunks in ~/athenaeum/Codex-Stream/raw/gmail/
- [ ] dropped.log has entries for low-quality chunks
- [ ] Entities extracted and co-occurrence edges created
- [ ] Hotness counters incremented
- [ ] Cleanup cron: 30-day TTL enforced, entities promoted at ≥5 mentions
```

## Stream C: Pre-Wizard Backend

> Prerequisite endpoints the onboarding wizard calls. Build these BEFORE T15 (wizard UI).

### T15a — Hardware Detection Endpoint

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Depends on** | Nothing |
| **Files** | `~/pantheon/webui/api/onboarding.py` (get_hardware_info), `~/pantheon/webui/api/routes.py` (route handler) |

**What:** Endpoint that probes the host machine and returns model recommendations. Detects total RAM, CPU cores, and GPU availability (via `lspci` or similar). Maps to one of three tiers: 8GB, 16GB, 16GB+GPU. Returns recommended Ollama models for that tier.

**Response shape:**
```json
{
  "tier": "16gb_gpu",
  "ram_gb": 32,
  "cpu_cores": 16,
  "gpu_detected": true,
  "gpu_name": "NVIDIA RTX 3060",
  "recommended_models": ["qwen2.5:14b", "deepseek-r1:14b", "gemma3:12b"],
  "embedding_model": "nomic-embed-text"
}
```

**🚦 QA Gate T15a:**
```
- [ ] Returns valid JSON with all fields
- [ ] Correctly detects RAM via /proc/meminfo or sysctl
- [ ] Detects GPU via lspci | grep -i vga
- [ ] Falls back to tier "8gb" if detection fails
- [ ] Embedding model always "nomic-embed-text"
- [ ] Curl: curl -s http://localhost:8787/api/onboarding/hardware
```

---

### T15b — Ollama Model Install + Download Script

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Commit** | `4bb05d3` (Pantheon repo) |
| **Depends on** | T15a |
| **Files** | `~/pantheon/scripts/onboarding/setup-ollama-models.sh` |

**What:** Script that installs Ollama if not present, then pulls user-selected models + `nomic-embed-text`. Called by the wizard UI during Step 2 (Local path). Reports download progress. Returns JSON status.

**🚦 QA Gate T15b:**
```
- [ ] Detects if ollama is installed; if not, runs: curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
- [ ] Accepts model list as argument: setup-ollama-models.sh qwen2.5:7b llama3.1:8b
- [ ] Auto-includes nomic-embed-text in every pull
- [ ] Reports per-model status (pending/downloading/done/error)
- [ ] Idempotent: already-pulled models return "done" immediately
- [ ] Works from wizard UI: subprocess.run with progress parsing
- [ ] Test: bash ~/pantheon/scripts/onboarding/setup-ollama-models.sh qwen2.5:3b
```

---

### T15c — OpenCode Go API Verification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Depends on** | Nothing |
| **Files** | Olympus backend: `POST /api/onboarding/verify-opencode` |

**What:** Endpoint that validates an OpenCode Go API key by making a test call. Returns success + model list, or error with message. Referral link embedded in response for frontend display.

**Response shape:**
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "models_available": ["deepseek-v4-flash-free", "deepseek-v4-pro", "..."],
  "referral_url": "https://opencode.ai/go?ref=3QSR50S9K2",
  "error": null
}
```

**🚦 QA Gate T15c:**
```
- [ ] Valid key → returns valid:true + model list
- [ ] Invalid key → returns valid:false + error message
- [ ] Referral link always included in response
- [ ] Timeout after 10s (don't hang the wizard)
- [ ] Curl: curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/onboarding/verify-opencode -d '{"api_key":"sk-..."}'
```

---

### T15d — God Registration Endpoint

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Depends on** | Nothing |
| **Files** | Olympus backend: `POST /api/onboarding/register-gods` |

**What:** Endpoint that registers the core gods (Hermes + Hephaestus) during onboarding. Calls `/api/gods/summon` internally for each. Returns per-god status. Hermes is the default profile so it may already exist — handle gracefully. Hephaestus needs a full summon (SOUL.md + god.json).

**Response shape:**
```json
{
  "gods": [
    {"name": "hermes", "status": "already_exists"},
    {"name": "hephaestus", "status": "registered", "display_name": "Hephaestus"}
  ],
  "all_registered": true
}
```

**🚦 QA Gate T15d:**
```
- [ ] POST with no body registers both Hermes + Hephaestus
- [ ] Hermes already exists → returns "already_exists" (no error)
- [ ] Hephaestus summon creates full profile with SOUL.md + god.json
- [ ] Gods visible in GodPicker after registration (GET /api/gods includes both)
- [ ] Re-run is idempotent (both return "already_exists")
- [ ] Curl: curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8787/api/onboarding/register-gods
```

### T15 — Onboarding Wizard (P3b)

> **DESIGN DECISION (2026-05-28):** Replaced Cloud/Custom branching with Local/BYOK. Cloud path was OpenHuman artifact — Pantheon runs locally. Personalities moved to god SOUL.md (not global config). Voice is skip-able. Search is background-configured (DDGS + Scrapeling), not a user step. Core gods (Hermes + Hephaestus) auto-registered during wizard.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Commits** | `b5f0c32` (G2), `00a3463` (G3), `78f05f7` (fixes), `88f3778` (tests) |
| **Depends on** | T14, T4 |
| **Note** | 6 route files + onboarding-store.ts + 8 test files (110 tests). Browser QA: all 6 pages render with zero JS errors. Hardware detection works. Guard redirects work. Mobile/keyboard QA deferred to polish pass. |
| **Files** | `src/routes/onboarding/` (6 route files), `src/stores/onboarding-store.ts`. Modify: `src/routes/__root.tsx`, router |

**What:** First-run wizard shown to new users. 6 steps:

```
Step 1 — Welcome         Intro + "Get Started"
Step 2 — Runtime Choice  Local (hardware detect → model picker → Ollama download)
                         vs BYOK (OpenCode Go referral link + API key paste)
                         Both paths auto-download nomic-embed-text
Step 3 — Register Gods   Auto-register Hermes + Hephaestus (visible in GodPicker)
Step 4 — Integrations    OAuth connections: Gmail, GitHub, Slack [SKIP-ABLE]
Step 5 — Voice           Voice provider: faster-whisper base/small, whisper.cpp medium [SKIP-ABLE]
Step 6 — Complete        "You're ready" → onboarding_completed=true → redirect to /
```

**Guard:** `localStorage.getItem('onboarding_completed')` checked in `__root.tsx`. Wizard never runs again once completed.

**Local path models by tier:**
| RAM | Models |
|-----|--------|
| 8GB (no GPU) | `qwen2.5:3b`, `gemma3:4b`, `phi4-mini:3.8b` |
| 16GB (no GPU) | `qwen2.5:7b`, `mistral:7b`, `llama3.1:8b` |
| 16GB+ (GPU) | `qwen2.5:14b`, `deepseek-r1:14b`, `gemma3:12b` |

**Base config shipped:** Auto-compact on, guardrails, checkpoints, ichor memory, terminal local, browser auto. Personalities stripped (lives in SOUL.md). Critical cron jobs pre-configured: ichor-daily-maintenance, hades, pantheon-sync, Codex-Stream cleanup.

**🚦 QA Gate T15:**
```
COMPONENT TESTS:
- [ ] All 6 step components have *.test.tsx
- [ ] onboarding-store.test.ts → PASS
- [ ] Local path: hardware detect → model selection → download trigger
- [ ] BYOK path: referral link → API key input → validation

- [ ] Local: model tier shown based on detected hardware
- [ ] BYOK: OpenCode Go link opens in new tab, API key field validates
- [ ] Gods step: auto-registers Hermes + Hephaestus (visible in GodPicker after)
- [ ] Integrations: OAuth cards render, Skip button works
- [ ] Voice: model picker renders, Skip button works
- [ ] Complete → redirected to / (chat), onboarding never shown again
- [ ] Reload page → no redirect (onboarding_completed=true)
- [ ] Mobile: steps full-width, buttons tappable (44px min)
- [ ] Keyboard: Tab through options, Enter to select, Escape for skip
- [ ] Zero console errors
- [ ] git branch verified before browser QA

- [ ] Survives logout (linger keeps user session alive)
- [ ] Commit: "feat(obsidian): Codex-Stream → Obsidian vault mirror"
```

---

### T22 — Agent Retrieval Tools (P4b)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | 🔲 |
| **Depends on** | T13 (data + entity co-occurrence in Ichor graph) |
| **Files** | `~/.hermes/plugins/stream-retrieval/` |

**What:** Hermes plugin exposing 6 retrieval tools: `stream_search`, `stream_filter`, `stream_entity`, `stream_trending`, `stream_connections`, `stream_fetch_chunks`. FTS5 + ChromaDB hybrid search. Entity lookups via Ichor graph.

**🚦 QA Gate T22:**

## Stream D: n8n Migration (2026-05-29)

> **Decision:** Composio broken — 2/8 active connections, 6 silently dropped by API. n8n self-hosted Docker verified: 449 credential types, one-click OAuth, REST API, MCP server at `localhost:5678/mcp-server/http`. Full plan: `~/pantheon/docs/olympus/n8n-migration-plan.md`

### Composio Post-Mortem (2026-05-29)
Gmail ✅ / GitHub ✅ actually connected. Google Calendar ❌, Google Drive ❌, Notion ❌ — user connected in UI, API reports zero accounts. Slack ❌, Discord ❌, Outlook ❌ — never connected. Root cause: Composio silently drops OAuth connections.

---

### N1 — Sidebar Reorder + Settings Move

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Priority** | P0 — unblocks admin access |
| **Depends on** | Nothing |
| **Files** | `src/components/shell/Sidebar.tsx` |
| **Commit** | `554743c` |

Admin shield → bottom of collapsed rail (where Settings is). Settings gear → beside Profile avatar. Remove Settings text label in expanded drawer. One file change.

### N2 — n8n Feature Toggle + Sidebar Icon

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Priority** | P0 — enables n8n visibility |
| **Depends on** | N1 |
| **Files** | `feature-flag-store.ts`, `AdminPanel.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `AdminPanel.test.tsx`, `feature-flag-store.test.ts` |
| **Commit** | `cbdff27` |

Add `n8n` toggle (default OFF) to feature flag system. Workflow icon in rail between Athenaeum and Stream. Hidden when toggle OFF. 5 file locations per feature-flag pattern.

### N3 — n8n API Client + Olympus Routes

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Priority** | P0 — backend for onboarding |
| **Commit** | `fb753d3` |
| **Depends on** | n8n Docker running |
| **Files** | `~/pantheon/webui/api/n8n_client.py`, `routes.py`, `olympus_users.py`, `.env` |

Python wrapper for n8n REST API (363 lines). 5 endpoints verified: `GET /api/n8n/status`, `GET /api/n8n/credentials`, `GET /api/n8n/credentials/{provider}`, `POST /api/n8n/credentials/{provider}/connect`. BYOK-aware with .env fallback loader. n8n feature flag in backend. n8n Docker `unless-stopped` policy configured.

### N4 — Onboarding + Settings Integration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Priority** | P1 — replaces Composio in user flow |
| **Commit** | `b6e2bb8` (Pantheon backend), `8506bde` (Olympus-UI frontend) |
| **Depends on** | N3 |
| **Files** | `integrations.lazy.tsx`, `ConnectionManager.tsx`, `useOAuth.ts`, `onboarding-store.ts`, `feature-flag-store.ts`, `n8n_client.py`, `routes.py` |

Replace Composio with n8n in onboarding Step 4 and Settings → Integrations tab. Same UI (brand icons, cards, Skip button), different backend. Flow: Connect → n8n OAuth URL → user authorizes → poll status → ✅.

### N5 — MCP Server + Core Workflows

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ✅ |
| **Priority** | P1 — enables Hermes agent tools |
| **Commit** | `8506bde`+ (Olympus-UI), n8n MCP STDIO server at `~/.hermes/mcp-servers/n8n-server.py` |
| **Depends on** | N3 |
| **Files** | `~/.hermes/mcp-servers/n8n-server.py`, `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (via `hermes mcp add`) |

**What was built:**
- STDIO MCP server (Python) wrapping the n8n REST API as 6 MCP tools
- Registered via `hermes mcp add n8n` — 6/6 tools enabled

**6 MCP tools discovered:**
| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `n8n_health` | Check if n8n is running |
| `n8n_list_workflows` | List all workflows with IDs, names, status |
| `n8n_run_workflow` | Execute/trigger a workflow by ID |
| `n8n_list_credentials` | List all connected credentials |
| `n8n_credential_status` | Check specific provider credential |
| `n8n_create_credential_url` | Get n8n URL to set up a credential |

**Architecture:** Instead of n8n's HTTP MCP server (auth plane mismatch), built a local STDIO MCP subprocess that speaks MCP over stdin/stdout. Hermes launches it, discovers tools, no auth battles.

**Start a new session to see them:** `mcp_n8n_health`, `mcp_n8n_list_workflows`, etc.

### N6 — Composio Deprecation (REVISED 2026-05-30)

> **⚠️ Previously marked ✅ but was incomplete.** The initial pass only cleaned runtime config (env vars, MCP server, cron symlink). The repo still has composio code in 26 tracked files. This revision defines the full scope.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 🔲 |
| **Priority** | P2 — repo must be COMPLETELY clean of composio |
| **Depends on** | N4, N5 |

**What was done (runtime cleanup, keeping):**
- COMPOSIO env keys removed from `~/.hermes/.env`
- composio MCP server removed from Hermes config
- sync cron symlink removed
- `docs/olympus/deprecated/composio-setup.md` archived

**What remains (the real scope — 28 items across 5 phases):**

#### N6a — Purge composio from repo (delete/strip)
| # | File | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `bundles/composio-mcp/composio-mcp.yaml` | `git rm` — delete entire `bundles/composio-mcp/` |
| 2 | `bundles/composio-mcp/setup_credentials.py` | `git rm` (same bundle) |
| 3 | `bundles/composio-mcp/README.md` | `git rm` (same bundle) |
| 4 | `docs/olympus/deprecated/composio-setup.md` | `git rm` — remove deprecated doc entirely |
| 5 | `webui/api/onboarding.py` lines 1311-1513 | Remove `save_composio_key()`, `check_composio()`, `get_composio_connections()` (~200 lines) |

## Tier 7 — Backend Refactor (Post-Ship)

> **Decision (2026-05-30):** The 8787 `routes.py` monolith (11,967 lines, stdlib `http.server`) is serving both static files and API — two jobs in one process with the wrong tool. This tier retires 8787 after Phase 1 ships, replacing it with purpose-built components. **Phase 1 completes first (37/37). Phase 2 runs beside live on port 8788 — no downtime.**

### Problem

`routes.py` is a single-file monolith with manual `if parsed.path.startswith(...)` routing for every endpoint in the system. It also serves static files (CSS, JS, favicon) — a job better done by a web server. Every new feature adds ~50 lines to the same file. The stdlib server was never designed for production API serving.

### Architecture Decision

```
Before (now):                    After (Tier 7):
                                 
Browser → 8787 (static)          Browser → Caddy (static, HTTPS)
Browser → 8787 (API monolith)    Browser → Caddy → Fastify/Bun (API)
Agent   → n8n MCP                Agent   → n8n MCP (unchanged)
8787    → n8n REST               8787    → retired
```

Each concern gets one owner:
- **Static assets** → Caddy (4MB binary, auto-HTTPS, zero config)
- **API** → Fastify or Bun (native async, proper routing, 10-50x throughput)
- **Integrations + agent tools** → n8n MCP (already at `localhost:5678`)

### Strategy: Build Beside, Flip Switch

| Phase | What | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** (current) | Finish 37/37 on 8787. Ship. | None — live stays live |
| **Phase 2** (Tier 7) | New backend on port 8788. Olympus-UI proxies to 8788. Verify all endpoints. | None — runs beside, not instead of |
| **Cutover** | Flip one config line: proxy target 8787→8788. Wait 24h. Retire 8787. | 30-second blip if we mistime |

### T25 — Caddy Static Server

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 🔲 |
| **Priority** | P0 — unblocks API refactor |
| **Depends on** | Phase 1 complete (37/37) |
| **Files** | `Caddyfile`, systemd unit |

**What:** Install Caddy, configure to serve `~/Olympus-UI/dist/` (built React app) on port 443 with auto-HTTPS via Tailscale. Remove all `_serve_static`, `_STATIC_MIME`, file-serving logic from routes.py. Olympus-UI frontend assets never touch Python again.

**🚦 QA Gate T25:**
```
- [ ] Caddy installed and running as systemd service
- [ ] https://pantheon.tail164759.ts.net serves Olympus-UI
- [ ] All static assets load (CSS, JS, fonts, favicon, manifest)
- [ ] Auto-HTTPS certificate provisioned via Tailscale
- [ ] ~2,000 lines cut from routes.py (static serving dead code)
- [ ] 8787 serves API-only — no static file handling
```

### T26 — Split routes.py Into Modules

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 🔲 |
| **Priority** | P1 — reduces tech debt |
| **Depends on** | T25 (static gone, less to split) |
| **Files** | `webui/api/routes/*.py` (auth, n8n, athenaeum, chat, gods, etc.) |

**What:** Break the 11,967-line monolith into per-domain modules. Each module registers its own path handlers. The main `routes.py` becomes a thin dispatcher that imports and delegates. Zero performance change — pure organization. Each module ~200 lines instead of a 12K-line file.

**Modules:** `auth.py`, `n8n.py`, `athenaeum.py`, `chat.py`, `gods.py`, `sessions.py`, `kanban.py`, `stream.py`, `onboarding.py`, `terminal.py`, `cron.py`, `mcp.py`, `feature_flags.py`, `workspace.py`, `users.py`, `health.py`

**🚦 QA Gate T26:**
```
- [ ] Every existing endpoint still works (curl all /api/* paths)
- [ ] Each module ≤500 lines
- [ ] No circular imports
- [ ] All 510+ existing tests pass
- [ ] routes.py reduced to dispatcher (<200 lines)
```

### T27 — Fastify/Bun API Server

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 🔲 |
| **Priority** | P1 — production-grade API serving |
| **Depends on** | T26 (routes modularized, easier to port) |
| **Files** | `~/pantheon/api-server/` (new TypeScript project) |

**What:** Replace the Python `http.server` with Fastify (Node) or Bun (native TS runtime). Proper routing (`fastify.get('/api/n8n/credentials/:provider', handler)`), request validation, async/await, middleware, JSON schema responses. Same API contract — Olympus-UI and Hermes Agent don't care what language the API server is in.

**Why TypeScript:** Olympus-UI is already TypeScript. One language for the whole stack. Shared types between frontend and API server. Bun serves 50K req/s vs Python's 3K. Memory footprint ~20MB vs Python's ~200MB.

**🚦 QA Gate T27:**
```
- [ ] New server running on port 8788
- [ ] All /api/* endpoints respond identically to 8787
- [ ] Olympus-UI works against 8788 (proxy target flip)
- [ ] Response times equal or faster than 8787
- [ ] Hermes Agent internals still callable (subprocess or IPC)
- [ ] All integration tests pass against 8788
```

### T28 — Cutover + Retire 8787

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 🔲 |
| **Priority** | P2 — cleanup |
| **Depends on** | T25, T26, T27 verified |
| **Files** | Vite proxy config, systemd units |

**What:** Flip Vite proxy target from 8787 to 8788. Run both for 24h to catch edge cases. If stable, stop the 8787 systemd unit. Archive the routes.py monolith for reference. Breathe.

**🚦 QA Gate T28:**
```
- [ ] Vite proxy target: 8787 → 8788
- [ ] Olympus-UI works for 24h with zero 8787 traffic
- [ ] 8787 process stopped
- [ ] No regressions reported
- [ ] routes.py archived, not deleted
- [ ] Commit: "feat: retire 8787 — Tier 7 complete"
```

**Phase 2: 0/4 Tier 7 tasks — post-ship, runs parallel on port 8788**

### Reconciliation Notes (2026-05-30)
- **N6 revised:** Was incorrectly marked ✅. Original scope (runtime cleanup) complete but repo purge was missed. 26 tracked files still contain composio. Split into N6a-N6d subtasks covering: delete bundles, strip webui code, update docs/planning, rewrite cron adapters to n8n API, verify zero composio remains.
- **Build count adjusted:** 36/37 → 33/38. N6 expanded from 1 task → 4 subtasks.
- **Composio purge audit:** Full map of 28 items at `docs/olympus/BUILD_TRACKER.md` (N6 section).
