# Olympus UI Decisions

> Raw running decision log for Olympus UI. Capture first, organize later.
>
> Olympus UI is the planned clean, packaged, themeable, feature-flagged, multi-user frontend shell around Hermes Agent. Pantheon is one deployment/theme, not the only product shape.

## 2026-05-22 — Foundational Product Shape

### Product framing

- Olympus UI should be a packaged frontend shell around Hermes Agent, not a hardcoded Pantheon-only UI.
- Pantheon/god terminology should be a theme/deployment layer, not mandatory client-facing terminology.
- The same general shape and UX should be maintainable across deployments while allowing branding, images, colors, terminology, and features to change.
- Client deployments may hide advanced controls that are useful to Konan/operator users.

### Themeability and branding

- Olympus UI should be extremely themeable.
- Use global design tokens / global CSS variables for core visual identity:
  - colors
  - logos/images
  - typography
  - backgrounds
  - glow/effects
  - spacing/radius/density
- Swapping branding should not require editing component code.
- Pantheon mythology terms should be configurable via terminology mapping.
  - Example: `god` can display as `Assistant` for clients.
  - Example: `boon` can display as `Document`, `Output`, or another client-friendly term.

### Feature flags and personalization

- Olympus UI needs easy feature/function toggles.
- Some users/deployments should not see advanced features such as mid-conversation model switching.
- Example: a simple client/grandma user likely does not need a model picker.
- Konan/operator users do need advanced controls like model picker, provider settings, tools, diagnostics, etc.
- Feature visibility should be configurable by deployment and role.
- Frontend feature hiding is UX only; backend permissions must enforce authority.

### Configuration backend / admin surface

- Olympus should include a configuration/admin area, likely at a specific route such as `/admin`.
- Admin/config UI should make personalization quick and easy with toggles and simple controls.
- Admin surface should manage:
  - branding
  - theme/colors/images
  - feature flags
  - visible navigation items
  - agents/profiles exposed to users
  - model availability/defaults where permitted
  - role/user access
- Admin surface should be separate from normal end-user flow.

## 2026-05-22 — Multi-user Model

### Keep multi-user simple, but do not paint into a corner

- Multi-user support is required for Olympus UI on a single install.
- Initial implementation should stay simple and likely remain simple for a while.
- Architecture must avoid choices that block later expansion.

### Human users vs Hermes profiles

- Human user profiles and Hermes/agent profiles are distinct concepts.
- Olympus user profile = human account.
- Hermes/agent profile = runtime assistant/persona/domain profile.
- Keep naming clear to avoid confusion.

### Session ownership and profile tagging

- Every session must belong to a human user.
- Every session must also be tagged by an agent/profile.
- Profiles are a primary sorting method for finding sessions.
- Profile tagging keeps conversations from getting lost and keeps work in the right domain.
- Conceptual minimum fields:
  - `session.user_id`
  - `session.profile_id` or `agent_profile_id`
  - `session.hermes_session_id`
  - timestamps/title/etc.

### Shared vs private resources

- Shared/private resource model is important but currently **TBD**.
- This includes documents/boons, session visibility, shared knowledge, and user-owned outputs.
- Mark as open design area; do not prematurely lock the model.

### User preferences

Human user profile should include at least:

- display name
- avatar
- user color
- density preference: compact vs comfortable
- preferred language

Color picker UX:

- Should be simple and familiar.
- Offer ~six primary color presets.
- Also offer a custom option.
- Custom color selection should use familiar RGB/gradient-style picker UX rather than requiring hex-code knowledge.
- Hex codes can exist under the hood but should not be the main user-facing interaction.

Accessibility settings:

- Mark as **discussion needed**.
- Potential examples to define later:
  - text size
  - reduced motion
  - high contrast
  - dyslexia-friendly font
  - screen-reader/keyboard preferences

Preferred language:

- Low cost to include; include it in the user profile model.

### Role-based feature access

- Agree that feature access should be role/config based.
- Same install can expose different surfaces to different users.
- Example:
  - normal user: simple chat/history/documents
  - power user/operator: model picker, tools, diagnostics, provider settings

### Agent/profile visibility

- Olympus should support showing/hiding agents that exist on the install.
- Users should only see the agents/profiles they are allowed to access.
- This supports both Pantheon-style multi-god installs and client installs with only one or a few assistants exposed.

### Memory scoping

- Memory scoping is important but currently **TBD**.
- Need later design for how user memory, agent/profile memory, deployment memory, and shared memory interact.
- Do not overcommit yet.

### Logs and auditability

- Olympus needs logs.
- Audit/event logging should exist for important system actions.
- Examples likely include:
  - user login/logout
  - config changes
  - feature flag changes
  - model/provider changes
  - agent/profile visibility changes
  - exports/shares
  - admin actions

### Foundation

- **assistant-ui** is the chosen frontend foundation for Olympus UI.
- Evaluation done: assistant-ui fits the AI-chat-native requirements (streaming, tool calls, markdown rendering, multi-model) without reinventing wheels.
- Decision made before Phases 1–4 were completed — this overrides the original "Phase 5" foundation choice order. assistant-ui is locked in; the remaining planning phases adapt around it.

## Open Questions / TBD

- Exact shared/private resource visibility model.
- Memory scoping model.
- Accessibility settings list and UX.
- Exact role names and permissions.
- Whether Olympus is standalone repo, monorepo package, or initially inside Pantheon.
- Exact config schema format: YAML, JSON, database-backed, or hybrid.
- Auth method for MVP: local accounts, invite links, OAuth, magic links, etc.

## Working Principle

Capture decisions in this document as they happen. Organize later. Avoid losing product/UX decisions in chat history.
